    <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
    <p>
      I made this website over the course of a couple days. I have made websites
      before but have been out of touch, so I decided to make a new one. <br />
      It's pretty simple as you can see, but I had to start somewhere. <br />
      At the top you can see a navigation bar that will take you to my other
      connected pages. Click on each option to see where it takes you! <br />
      I hope you enjoy and find it to be somewhat decent for a starter page.
      Thank you. <br />
      - With regards, Martin.
